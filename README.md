### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#My name is Holden and my email address is hjstrong@my.waktech.edu

My GitHub was created so I can learn web development languages (for now)
This repository is just for to have my own personal website I guess?
I followed the steps on the github assignment doc and then used the instructions on this link to make it a website: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
